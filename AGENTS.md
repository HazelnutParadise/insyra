# AGENTS.md

This file is the primary guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` re-exports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## What This Repo Is

**Insyra** (`github.com/HazelnutParadise/insyra`) is a Go data analysis library (v0.3.x, "Huashan") providing:
- `DataList` and `DataTable` as the core data structures
- **CCL** (Column Calculation Language) — a domain-specific expression language for column transforms
- A CLI/REPL (`insyra` binary) built with Cobra
- Sub-packages for stats, plotting, LP, Python interop, parallel processing, file I/O, etc.

## Required artifacts

Each entry says *when* reading it stops being optional. That trigger is the part that only exists here — the files describe their own contents.

- [`ENG.md`](ENG.md) — the project's standing technical decisions: architecture, test seams, the precision contract, the measured thresholds, the assumptions everything rests on. **Read it before changing architecture, choosing a test seam, deciding what precision something runs at, or writing a migration.** Do not re-derive any of it from scratch; if a decision there is wrong, change it there.
- [`delivery-status.md`](delivery-status.md) — where the project currently stands: phase, blockers, next output, next ticket. **Read it first on arrival.** It is deltas only, not a roadmap or a changelog.
- [`openspec/changes/`](openspec/changes/) — the tickets. **Pick up anything whose blockers are all done**; the milestone order in `delivery-status.md` carries the blocking edges, because OpenSpec has none between changes. Completed changes live in `archive/`.

## Change Workflow — OpenSpec (required)

**Every non-trivial change goes through the OpenSpec workflow.** This repo is
OpenSpec-initialized (see `openspec/`). Do NOT implement a feature, breaking
change, new package, or substantial fix straight into the code — drive it
through a change first:

1. **Propose** — create the change (proposal + spec deltas + tasks) under
   `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` (`openspec-propose` / `openspec-new-change`).
2. **Apply** — implement the tasks (`openspec-apply-change`).
3. **Verify** — confirm the implementation matches the artifacts
   (`openspec-verify-change`).
4. **Archive** — once the change is implemented and merged, archive it into
   `openspec/changes/archive/` (`openspec-archive-change`). **Completed changes
   must be archived, not left sitting in `openspec/changes/`.**

Trivial edits (typos, formatting, comment/doc-only touch-ups) may skip OpenSpec.
When in doubt, propose a change. The docs/changelog/skills-in-sync rule below
still applies to whatever the change touches.

`CLAUDE.md` (and `cli/CLAUDE.md`, `stats/CLAUDE.md`) are `@AGENTS.md` includes,
so this policy applies to every agent tool that reads either file.

## Acceleration (`accel`) Operating Contract

Applies to every accel-related task. It extends the OpenSpec workflow above; it does not replace it.

### Required Entry Sequence
- Read `delivery-status.md` before doing any accel-related work.
- Use `delivery-status.md` as the source of truth for current phase, blockers, next verifiable output, and next OpenSpec change.
- Read the named OpenSpec change before proposing implementation or writing code.

### Required Artifacts
- `delivery-status.md` is the shared progress and handoff surface.
- `openspec/changes/` holds the executable units of work.

### Planning Discipline
- The accel phase may not use umbrella proposals. One change must produce one verifiable result.
- Do not start implementation for uncovered accel scope. Missing proposal coverage means the work is out of bounds.
- Full GPU string kernels are not a deferred track any more; the change that deferred them was withdrawn on 2026-08-01. A string kernel produces new values, which the result-shape rule below places behind an explicit opt-in rather than in a later phase. Do not reintroduce the deferral.
- Preserve the fixed architecture defaults unless a new decision is logged in `delivery-status.md`:
  - optional `insyra/accel` package family
  - `CUDA + Metal + WebGPU native`
  - heterogeneous multi-GPU only for shardable columnar operations in v1
  - observable CPU fallback by default, strict GPU-only as opt-in

### Update Discipline
- Update `delivery-status.md` after every milestone, blocker, or handoff.
- Change the named next OpenSpec change when the recommended pickup point changes.
- Update this contract only when operating rules change.

### Accel OpenSpec Rules
- Every active accel stage item must map to one OpenSpec change.
- Every OpenSpec change must map to one milestone and one verifiable output.
- Validate changed proposals with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` before handoff.
- Do not merge unrelated capability slices into one change.

### Handoff Requirements
Every accel handoff must include:
- current phase
- blocker status
- next verifiable output
- next OpenSpec change
- decision delta since previous handoff
- source links for critical context
- whether `delivery-status.md` changed
- whether `AGENTS.md` changed

### How the CPU and the GPU Divide the Work

Acceleration is meant to be on by default and to change no numbers. Those two goals only hold together under one arrangement: **the GPU proposes, the CPU decides.** The device does the bulk arithmetic in `f32` and narrows the answer down; the CPU settles what is left in `float64`. Never send a `float64` result to the device and hand back what comes off it.

Whether an operation may be accelerated by default is decided by the **shape of its result**, not by how hot it is:

| Result shape | Default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A selection — which row, which index, what order | on | The device's `f32` ranking is a proposal. The CPU recomputes the shortlist in `float64` and picks, so the answer is exact. |
| Values in a type the device holds exactly — native `float32`, integers inside `int32` range, `bool` | on | Bit-identical outright; no verification needed. |
| New `float64` values — elementwise math, CCL value expressions | opt-in only | Nothing verifies them more cheaply than recomputing them, and WebGPU has no `f64`. Requires an explicit `PrecisionFloat32`. |

Implementing a selection-shaped operation:

1. The device returns the best *k* candidates per row, not the winner, plus enough information to tell when the boundary between candidate *k* and candidate *k+1* falls inside the `f32` error bound.
2. The CPU recomputes those *k* candidates in `float64` and decides.
3. Rows whose boundary is untrustworthy are recomputed against every candidate. Measured on cluster assignment this was 12 rows in 200,000, so the exact path costs almost nothing.
4. The result is asserted equal to the pure-`float64` reference, not merely close to it.

Two rules follow and are not negotiable:

- **A missing or broken device is a performance event, never a correctness one.** The verification half is a complete implementation, so no device means every row takes the full CPU path — the code that already runs for the untrustworthy rows. Every operation returns its answer whether or not a device ran; `Accelerated` and `FallbackReason` report where the work happened, not whether it worked. The exceptions are a request the caller's own terms made ineligible, and strict GPU mode, which exists to fail.
- **Do not write a kernel for an operation measurement says the device loses.** Memory-bound work — column sums, means, simple scans — stays on the CPU permanently. Measure before proposing a kernel, and record the number in `delivery-status.md`.

### Implementation Constraints
- Do not silently reinterpret existing `DataList.Map(func...)` or `DataTable.Map(func...)` as GPU kernels.
- Keep accel runtime opt-in and package-scoped until the relevant OpenSpec changes are implemented and approved.
- Treat Apple shared-memory residency separately from discrete VRAM in specs and docs.
- Keep CLI/DSL exposure aligned with the named accel change; do not implement commands outside validated proposal scope.

## Architecture

### Core Package (`github.com/HazelnutParadise/insyra`)

The root package defines everything central:
- [interfaces.go](interfaces.go) — `IDataList` and `IDataTable` interfaces (authoritative API surface)
- [datalist.go](datalist.go) / [datatable.go](datatable.go) — concrete implementations
- [ccl.go](ccl.go) — wires the CCL engine into `DataTable.AddColUsingCCL` etc.
- [config.go](config.go) — global `Config` singleton (log level, colored output, thread safety, panic behavior)
- [atomic.go](atomic.go) — actor-model serialization for thread-safe operations on DataList/DataTable
- [logger.go](logger.go) — structured logging used throughout

### Sub-packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `isr/` | Syntax-sugar wrappers — **preferred entry point for new code** |
| `stats/` | Statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, PCA, regression, …) |
| `plot/` | Interactive charts via go-echarts |
| `gplot/` | Static publication charts via gonum/plot |
| `csvxl/` | CSV and Excel I/O |
| `parquet/` | Parquet file I/O via Apache Arrow |
| `datafetch/` | HTTP data fetching helpers |
| `parallel/` | Parallel map/reduce over DataList/DataTable |
| `lp/` / `lpgen/` | Linear programming |
| `mkt/` | Market data helpers |
| `py/` | Python interop (runs Python via embedded env) |
| `pd/` | Pandas-like wrappers built on `py/` |
| `engine/` | Re-exported stable internals (BiIndex, Ring, AtomicDo, CCL compiler, sort utils) |
| `allpkgs/` | Blank-import of all packages for `go get` convenience |

### CLI (`cli/`)

Built with Cobra. Entry point: [cmd/insyra/main.go](cmd/insyra/main.go) → `cli.Execute()`.
- `cli/commands/` — individual subcommand implementations
- `cli/repl/` — interactive REPL and DSL session (`engine/dsl` exposes `DSLSession` for programmatic use)
- `cli/env/` — named environment management (variable persistence between sessions)
- `cli/style/` — terminal styling

### Internal packages (`internal/`)

Not exported to consumers. Key ones:
- `internal/ccl/` — CCL lexer, parser, AST, evaluator; `MapContext` for testing CCL without a DataTable
- `internal/core/` — `BiIndex` (bidirectional id↔name index), `Ring` (circular buffer)
- `internal/algorithms/` — parallel stable sort, `CompareAny` for mixed-type ordering

### CCL (Column Calculation Language)

CCL has two modes used by different DataTable methods:
- **Expression mode** (`AddColUsingCCL`, `EditColByIndexUsingCCL`, `EditColByNameUsingCCL`) — pure expressions only, no assignment
- **Statement mode** (`ExecuteCCL`) — supports assignment syntax and `NEW()` for creating columns

Column references use Excel-style indices (`A`, `B`, … `AA`, `AB`, …) or named references `['ColName']`.

## Key Conventions

- Column indexing is Excel-style alphabetic (`"A"`, `"B"`, `"AA"`), not numeric, for `GetCol`/`UpdateCol` etc.
- `GetRowIndexByName` returns `(-1, false)` when not found — always check the boolean, because `-1` is also a valid "last element" index in many `Get` methods.
- Thread safety is on by default via the actor model. `Config.Dangerously_TurnOffThreadSafety()` exists but is explicitly discouraged.
- `AtomicDo` serializes access to ONE instance (same-instance nesting is safe, e.g. `Stdev`→`Var`). To read/operate on MULTIPLE instances atomically, use `insyra.AtomicDoAll(func(){...}, a, b, ...)` — it locks all given DataList/DataTable instances together in a deadlock-free order. Do NOT nest `AtomicDo` on a *different* instance inside a callback: that inner call runs WITHOUT locking the other instance and can race a concurrent mutation. (`engine/atomic.AtomicDoN([]*Actor, f)` is the same primitive for arbitrary user structs holding an `*atomic.Actor`.)
- Error handling uses an instance-level `Err()` pattern rather than returning errors from every method (check `.Err()` after chained calls).
- The `isr` package is the recommended public API for new projects; the root `insyra` package is the implementation layer.

## Docs, Changelog & Skills Must Stay in Sync

Docs, the changelog, and skills are part of a change, not a follow-up. A feature is not done until these are updated in the **same** change.

**When adding a new package:**
- Create its doc page `Docs/<pkg>.md` (follow an existing page such as [Docs/finance.md](Docs/finance.md) / [Docs/stats.md](Docs/stats.md) for structure).
- Add a row to the package table in **both** README entry points — `## Packages` in [README.md](README.md) **and** `## 套件` in [README_TW.md](README_TW.md) — linking to `/Docs/<pkg>.md`.
- Update the docs index [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md) (the docsify home). `Docs/_sidebar.md` is generated — don't edit it by hand.
- Register the package in [allpkgs/allpkgs.go](allpkgs/allpkgs.go).

**When adding or changing any feature (new or existing package):**
- Update the relevant `Docs/*.md` page(s) to match the new/changed API.
- Update the agent skills so they reflect the change: [skills/insyra/](skills/insyra/) (Go API usage — `SKILL.md` and `references/`), and [skills/use-insyra-cli/](skills/use-insyra-cli/) when CLI/DSL usage is affected.
- When the change touches the CLI/REPL or the DSL, update the CLI (`cli/`) and its doc [Docs/cli-dsl.md](Docs/cli-dsl.md).

**When the change is visible to someone using the library or the CLI:**
- Add an entry under `## Unreleased` in **both** [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [CHANGELOG_TW.md](CHANGELOG_TW.md), in the same change. Under the OpenSpec workflow this belongs in the change's own `tasks.md` — never as a follow-up, and never written from memory at release time.
- Group entries under the same package headings the release notes use (`### Core`, `### CLI`, `` ### `stats` ``, …), one level deeper than a release note so that promoting `###` to `##` at release time produces the release note as-is. Append to the end of a package section rather than the top.
- Mark breaking changes the way past release notes do.
- Skip the entry when nothing user-visible changed: internal refactors, tests, formatting, assets, dependency bumps with no behavioral effect, and OpenSpec bookkeeping.
- At release time, rename `## Unreleased` to the version number in both files and open a fresh empty `## Unreleased` above it.

Keep the English ([README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), `Docs/`) and Traditional-Chinese ([README_TW.md](README_TW.md), [CHANGELOG_TW.md](CHANGELOG_TW.md)) docs in lockstep — never update one side without the other.

## Follow-ups

Out-of-scope issues discovered during development, waiting for a decision. Delete an entry once it is resolved.

### [2026-08-01] — multi-GPU planning exists, multi-GPU execution does not
- **Where**: `accel/planner.go` (`PlanShardable`, weighted per-device `ShardAssignment`s), `accel/executor.go:136` (`executionDevice`)
- **What**: the planner produces heterogeneous multi-device shard plans — capability-weighted assignments across every shardable device, with a merge policy — but execution then picks the single device carrying the largest share and runs the whole operation there. Every operation today, including the KNN exact-nearest path, executes on one card no matter how many are present. The v1 architecture default ("heterogeneous multi-GPU only for shardable columnar operations") describes the planner, not the executor.
- **Suggestion**: do not build it until a workload is measured to saturate one device. The KNN true-direction measurement points the other way for now: device wall time was flat in test rows (~467ms at 1k/2k/4k on 100k×32), meaning the single M3 was not saturated — a second card would have nothing to do below saturation. The first honest step is a saturation measurement (find the shape where device time starts scaling with rows); only past that point does splitting a plan across `Assignments` and merging under the existing `MergePolicy` pay. When it happens, `executionDevice` → per-assignment dispatch is the seam, and the exact-nearest verification half already merges per-row results without caring which device proposed them.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-08-01] — `ToF64Slice` still fabricates zeros for 54 callers outside `stats`
- **Where**: `datalist.go` `ToF64Slice`, and its callers in `plot/`, `gplot/`, `quant/`, `cli/`, `datalist_interpolation.go`
- **What**: it routes every value through `insyra.ToFloat64`, which has no failure channel and yields `0` for anything it cannot parse, then returns a full-length slice — so a caller cannot tell a real zero from a value that was never read. `stats` was moved off it on 2026-08-01 after a blank among six observations was measured moving a Pearson coefficient from 0.9992 to 0.9879. The remaining callers were left deliberately: they are display and reporting paths, where a fabricated zero shows up as a point on a chart rather than inside a coefficient.
- **Suggestion**: leave them, but decide rather than drift. If they are to stay, the method's doc comment should say what it does with a value it cannot read, because it currently does not. A new numeric analysis must not use it.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-08-01] — the GPU backend is verified on Apple and Metal only
- **Where**: `accel/`, the whole device path
- **What**: every numeric result the backend produces has been checked bit-for-bit against its CPU reference, but only on an Apple M3 through Metal. `add-accel-gpu-execution` required the same check on a Windows or Linux host with an NVIDIA or AMD GPU before archiving; no such machine was available and the task was closed without it. Bit-parity depends on both toolchains contracting multiply-add identically, which is a property of the platform rather than of the kernel — so it is measured where it runs and cannot be inferred for a platform nobody has run it on. Vulkan and DirectX 12 paths compile and are exercised by no numeric test.
- **Suggestion**: run `INSYRA_ACCEL_GPU_TESTS=1 go test ./accel/...` on a non-Apple host with a discrete GPU. If parity fails there, the fix is not a kernel change but a per-platform gate: the exact-nearest operation already recomputes untrustworthy rows in `float64`, so a platform that cannot match bit-for-bit can widen that path rather than lose the operation. Also worth measuring there is whether the profitability threshold moves — PCIe transfer should push it up, not down, and the value in `accel/exact.go` is calibrated on unified memory.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-08-01] — accel still transports strings that nothing can consume
- **Where**: `accel/dataset.go` (string buffers with offsets and data), `accel/cache.go` (their byte accounting)
- **What**: projection builds encoded-string buffers and the cache charges for them, but no operation accepts a string column — the sole remaining device operation requires numeric columns. This is left over from `add-accel-string-kernels-phase-2`, withdrawn on the same day: string kernels produce new values, which the acceleration rules place behind an explicit opt-in rather than a future phase.
- **Suggestion**: leave it or remove it, but decide rather than drift. Keeping it costs a little projection work on tables with string columns and would be needed again by any future string operation; removing it trims code that is currently unreachable. Neither is urgent.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-07-28] — gogpu's Metal path aborts under `-race`
- **Where**: `github.com/gogpu/wgpu@v0.30.23/hal/metal/objc.go:958`, reached through `go-webgpu/goffi`'s callback trampoline
- **What**: `-race` enables `checkptr`, which kills the process with `fatal error: checkptr: pointer arithmetic result points to invalid allocation` the first time a Metal completion block fires. No Insyra frame appears in the trace. Reproduced at the commit before the session-lock work, so it is upstream and pre-existing, not something the accel runtime introduced. Consequence: no test or benchmark that reaches a device can run under `-race` on macOS. Everything that stops short of the device still does.
- **Suggestion**: Report upstream with the stack trace; the pointer arithmetic in the completion-block invoke needs to keep the base pointer live in an `unsafe.Pointer` rather than deriving it from a `uintptr`. Meanwhile `requireGPU` and `gpuTestsEnabled` skip when the `race` build tag is set — remove those guards once upstream fixes it.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-07-26] — ReadExcelSheet does no type inference (inconsistent with CSV)
- **Where**: [read.go](read.go) `ReadExcelSheet` → `ReadSlice2D`
- **What**: excelize `GetRows` returns strings and `ReadSlice2D` appends them as-is, so Excel loads produce all-string DataTables while CSV loads run column-level inference (`inferCSVColumnTypes`). Opposite defaults for the two spreadsheet formats. Noticed while adding `CSVReadOptions.RawStrings` (issue #188).
- **Suggestion**: Decide whether Excel reads should run the same column inference by default (with the same opt-out), or stay raw; either way document the behavior in `Docs/DataTable.md`.
- **Status**: pending

### [2026-07-11] — chromedp chain left at pre-refresh versions (two independent blockers)
- **Where**: `go.mod` — `chromedp v0.11.2`, `cdproto v0.0.0-20241208230723-d1c7de7e5dd2` (pulled in via `go-echarts/snapshot-chromedp`)
- **What**: The 2026-07-11 dependency refresh could not move these. (1) `chromedp v0.15.0+` and newer `cdproto` require go >= 1.26, while the module's `go` directive stays on 1.25.x (minimum-Go promise to downstream users). (2) The newest go1.25-compatible version, `chromedp v0.14.2`, hard-requires `go-json-experiment/json`, whose generic-variadic code panics govulncheck's symbol-level scan ("got jsontext.Value, want variadic parameter of unnamed slice or string type" in x/tools go/ssa — still broken as of x/tools v0.48.0 / x/vuln v1.6.0), which would permanently break the Govulncheck CI workflow.
- **Suggestion**: When raising the minimum Go version to 1.26, retry upgrading the whole chain and re-verify `govulncheck ./...` completes (the x/tools SSA bug may be fixed by then).
- **Status**: pending
