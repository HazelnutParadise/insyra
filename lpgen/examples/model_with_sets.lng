! Production Planning with Sets
! Uses @SUM and @FOR functions
SETS:
PRODUCTS / P1 P2 P3 /;
RESOURCES / R1 R2 /;
ENDSETS

DATA:
PROFIT = 10 15 20;
CAPACITY = 100 80;
ENDDATA

MODEL:
! Maximize total profit
MAX = @SUM(PRODUCTS: PROFIT * X);

! Resource constraints (simplified for demonstration)
@FOR(PRODUCTS: X >= 0);
