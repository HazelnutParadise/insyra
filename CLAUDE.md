# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository, and is the project operating contract for Insyra acceleration planning and execution.

## Required Entry Sequence

- Read `delivery-plan.md` before doing any accel-related work.
- Use `delivery-plan.md` as the source of truth for current phase, blockers, next verifiable output, and next OpenSpec change.
- Read the named OpenSpec change before proposing implementation or writing code.

## Required Artifacts

- `delivery-plan.md` is the shared progress and handoff surface.
- `openspec/changes/` holds the executable units of work.
- `AGENTS.md` is a bootstrap pointer back to this file.

## Planning Discipline

- The accel phase may not use umbrella proposals. One change must produce one verifiable result.
- Do not start implementation for uncovered accel scope. Missing proposal coverage means the work is out of bounds.
- Keep Phase 1 and Phase 2 separate. Full GPU string kernels remain a Phase 2 track unless the delivery plan explicitly changes.
- Preserve the fixed architecture defaults unless a new decision is logged in `delivery-plan.md`:
  - optional `insyra/accel` package family
  - `CUDA + Metal + WebGPU native`
  - heterogeneous multi-GPU only for shardable columnar operations in v1
  - observable CPU fallback by default, strict GPU-only as opt-in

## Update Discipline

- Update `delivery-plan.md` after every milestone, blocker, or handoff.
- Change the named next OpenSpec change when the recommended pickup point changes.
- Update this file only when operating rules change.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` minimal unless its bootstrap pointer becomes wrong.

## OpenSpec Rules

- Every active accel stage item must map to one OpenSpec change.
- Every OpenSpec change must map to one milestone and one verifiable output.
- Validate changed proposals with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` before handoff.
- Do not merge unrelated capability slices into one change.

## Handoff Requirements

Every accel handoff must include:
- current phase
- blocker status
- next verifiable output
- next OpenSpec change
- decision delta since previous handoff
- source links for critical context
- whether `delivery-plan.md` changed
- whether `CLAUDE.md` changed

## Implementation Constraints

- Do not silently reinterpret existing `DataList.Map(func...)` or `DataTable.Map(func...)` as GPU kernels.
- Keep accel runtime opt-in and package-scoped until the relevant OpenSpec changes are implemented and approved.
- Treat Apple shared-memory residency separately from discrete VRAM in specs and docs.
- Keep CLI/DSL exposure aligned with the named accel change; do not implement commands outside validated proposal scope.

## What This Repo Is

**Insyra** (`github.com/HazelnutParadise/insyra`) is a Go data analysis library (v0.2.x, "Pier-2") providing:
- `DataList` and `DataTable` as the core data structures
- **CCL** (Column Calculation Language) — a domain-specific expression language for column transforms
- A CLI/REPL (`insyra` binary) built with Cobra
- Sub-packages for stats, plotting, LP, Python interop, parallel processing, file I/O, etc.

## Architecture

### Core Package (`github.com/HazelnutParadise/insyra`)

The root package defines everything central:
- [interfaces.go](interfaces.go) — `IDataList` and `IDataTable` interfaces (authoritative API surface)
- [datalist.go](datalist.go) / [datatable.go](datatable.go) — concrete implementations
- [ccl.go](ccl.go) — wires the CCL engine into `DataTable.AddColUsingCCL` etc.
- [config.go](config.go) — global `Config` singleton (log level, colored output, thread safety, panic behavior)
- [atomic.go](atomic.go) — actor-model serialization for thread-safe operations on DataList/DataTable
- [logger.go](logger.go) — structured logging used throughout

### Sub-packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `isr/` | Syntax-sugar wrappers — **preferred entry point for new code** |
| `stats/` | Statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, PCA, regression, …) |
| `plot/` | Interactive charts via go-echarts |
| `gplot/` | Static publication charts via gonum/plot |
| `csvxl/` | CSV and Excel I/O |
| `parquet/` | Parquet file I/O via Apache Arrow |
| `datafetch/` | HTTP data fetching helpers |
| `parallel/` | Parallel map/reduce over DataList/DataTable |
| `lp/` / `lpgen/` | Linear programming |
| `mkt/` | Market data helpers |
| `py/` | Python interop (runs Python via embedded env) |
| `pd/` | Pandas-like wrappers built on `py/` |
| `engine/` | Re-exported stable internals (BiIndex, Ring, AtomicDo, CCL compiler, sort utils) |
| `allpkgs/` | Blank-import of all packages for `go get` convenience |

### CLI (`cli/`)

Built with Cobra. Entry point: [cmd/insyra/main.go](cmd/insyra/main.go) → `cli.Execute()`.
- `cli/commands/` — individual subcommand implementations
- `cli/repl/` — interactive REPL and DSL session (`engine/dsl` exposes `DSLSession` for programmatic use)
- `cli/env/` — named environment management (variable persistence between sessions)
- `cli/style/` — terminal styling

### Internal packages (`internal/`)

Not exported to consumers. Key ones:
- `internal/ccl/` — CCL lexer, parser, AST, evaluator; `MapContext` for testing CCL without a DataTable
- `internal/core/` — `BiIndex` (bidirectional id↔name index), `Ring` (circular buffer)
- `internal/algorithms/` — parallel stable sort, `CompareAny` for mixed-type ordering

### CCL (Column Calculation Language)

CCL has two modes used by different DataTable methods:
- **Expression mode** (`AddColUsingCCL`, `EditColByIndexUsingCCL`, `EditColByNameUsingCCL`) — pure expressions only, no assignment
- **Statement mode** (`ExecuteCCL`) — supports assignment syntax and `NEW()` for creating columns

Column references use Excel-style indices (`A`, `B`, … `AA`, `AB`, …) or named references `['ColName']`.

## Key Conventions

- Column indexing is Excel-style alphabetic (`"A"`, `"B"`, `"AA"`), not numeric, for `GetCol`/`UpdateCol` etc.
- `GetRowIndexByName` returns `(-1, false)` when not found — always check the boolean, because `-1` is also a valid "last element" index in many `Get` methods.
- Thread safety is on by default via the actor model. `Config.Dangerously_TurnOffThreadSafety()` exists but is explicitly discouraged.
- Error handling uses an instance-level `Err()` pattern rather than returning errors from every method (check `.Err()` after chained calls).
- The `isr` package is the recommended public API for new projects; the root `insyra` package is the implementation layer.
